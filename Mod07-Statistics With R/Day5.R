# cream flavor. The companyâ€˜s marketing research department 
# surveyed 6,000 families and 335 of them
# showed interest in purchasing the new flavor. A 
# similar study made two year ago showed that 5% of the
# families would purchase the flavor. What should the
# company conclude regarding the new flavor?
